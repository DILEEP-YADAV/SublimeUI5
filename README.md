Introduction
============

[SAPUI5](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/) (Open Source version: [OpenUI5](sap.github.io/openui5/)) 
is a UI framework for modern HTML5 applications.  

Whatever others might tell you, you don't need to use Eclipse to develop apps in SAPUI5. If, like me, you
use Sublime Text, you can use this package to help you. It contains [snippets](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/sublime-text-3/extensibility/snippets.html) that make writing code
by hand easier. There are JavaScript, HTML and XML snippets, the latter being for building views in XML. Those
I've put in a separate 'XMLViews' folder; Sublime will still find them and invoke them on the appropriate tabtrigger.
